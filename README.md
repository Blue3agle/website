Meetjestad Website
==================
This git repository contains some of the scripts used on the Meetjestad
website. There are more, which have yet to be added (possibly after some
cleanup).

This repository intentionally does not contain the main website, which is built
using [Hypha](https://github.com/PlanBCode/hypha).

This repository on github can also be used to track bugs and feature requests
concerning the website (also for things regarding the main Hypha-based
website).
